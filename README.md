#### Preparation
``` git clone git@github.com:gabbah/scala_java.git ```

##### Intellij
Install scala language plugin. Open project (download takes a few minutes). Make sure any scala worksheets compiles and evaluates simply by making any change to it.

##### Eclipse
Install Scala IDE for eclipse (http://scala-ide.org/). Scala plugin for eclipse will not work as it does not provide latest scala version (2.12).  Open project and switch to branch "eclipse". Add nature scala to the project if it's not there already (right click on the root and choose from the context menu).
